"""
This program use the CKY algorithm to parse entered sentences according to
a given CNF grammer.

To execute, give one command line argument: the name of the grammer file.
The grammer in this file must be in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning each
nonterminal goes to either one terminal or two nonterminals.  The file
should contain 1 grammar rule per line in the format:

  S -> NP VP
  N -> the
  
All tokens (including ->) must be separated by whitespace.  
The left and right side of each rule should be separated by a -> token.
There should be only 1 left-side token for each rule and it should be a 
non-terminal.  There should be 1 or 2 right-side tokens for each rule.  
Non-terminals must start with a capital letter.  A token (except for ->) 
with any other starting character is considered a terminal.

The program will read one sentence per line from standard in, and
output a corresponding 'S' or 'not S' depending on whether the input
was a valid sentence or not.  End input with ^D on *nix or ^Z on Windows.  
You can also redirection input/output to/from files.
