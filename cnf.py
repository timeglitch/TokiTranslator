"""
This program converts a given grammar to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).

The program should be invoked with two command line arguments:
the name of the input file and the name of the output file.
The outputfile may be omitted, in which case output is printed
to the screen (stdout).  If the outputfile already exists, it will be 
over-written.

The input file should have one grammar rule per line using the format:
  
  S -> NP VP | IVP
  NP -> the N
  
All tokens (including -> and |) must be separated by whitespace.  
The left and right side of each rule should be separated by a -> token.
There should be only 1 left-side token for each rule and it should be a 
non-terminal.  There should be 1 or more right-side tokens for each rule.  
(That is, this program does not support empty right-sides or etas.)  
Non-terminal must start with a capital letter.  Non-terminals of the 
form PREFIX + '\d+' (where \d+ is one or more digits) are reserved and may 
not occur in the input grammar.  A token (except for -> or |) with 
any other starting character is considered a terminal.

The output will contain the same rules converted to CNF.  In CNF, each
rule translates a non-terminal to either 2 non-terminals or a 1 terminal.
